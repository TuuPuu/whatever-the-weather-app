# Whatever the Weather application üå§Ô∏è


## Description

I built the Weather Dashboard to provide users with current and future weather conditions for a given city. This project was motivated by the need for a simple and intuitive tool to check the weather forecast conveniently. 
The Weather Dashboard solves the problem of quickly accessing weather information for any city, including the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. 
As a super beginner in web development, this project helped me solidify my understanding of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.



## Installation
This site has been deployed and can be accessed at the following:


The repo for this can also be accessed here:

## Usage

1) Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the search input field.
2) Click the "Search" button to retrieve and display the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast.
3) View the city's search history in the sidebar.
4) Click on a city in the search history to see its weather details again.
